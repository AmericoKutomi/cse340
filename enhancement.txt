Objective: create a way for users to leave a review for vehicles

Description:
On the vehicle details page, user reviews will be shown. On this page, there will be a button to submit a new review. The user must be logged in. The system will only allow one review per user per vehicle.

1. Database interaction
  - creation of a new table user_review
  - creation of two constraints for foreign keys: account_id and inv_id

2. Model
  - creation of review-model.js
    - function getUserInvReview 
    - function getReviewByInvId
    - function registerReview
    - function updateReview

3. Controller
  - server.js: route /review implemented to route to reviewRoute.js
  - creation of reviewRoute.js
    - get /update/:invId implemented
    - post /update implemented
  - creation of reviewController.js 
    - by receiving the update command, the function checks if user_review_id is undefined. If it is undefined, it is a new review.
      - to add, it is called review-model registerReview
      - to update, it is called review-model updateReview

4. View
  Part 1: show reviews
  - To see the reviews, there is no change in vehicle.ejs because the reviews are part of "grid", which is created in invController.buildByInventoryId
  - utilities.buildVehicleDetail (called from invController.buildByInventoryId) changed to show the reviews.

  Part 2: to add or edit a review
  - edit-review.ejs created
  - reviewController.buildEditReview created to render the register review page
  - script to enable button only after some change in the form done

5. Data validation
  - review-validation.js
    - reviewRules implemented
    - checkReviewData implemented

6. Error Handling
  - reviews can be done only by logged users.
